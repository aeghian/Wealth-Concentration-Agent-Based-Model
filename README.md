The following program was created for my Undergraduate Honors Thesis for Bryant University titled "Examining Depreciation and Wealth Concentration Through Agent-Based Modeling". The full paper is provided in the repository. The following program is based on the abcEconomics library also written in Python. The documentation is available here https://abce.readthedocs.io/en/master/. The program was not packaged and given a GUI because of the final implementation. Unfortunately due to how derivatives are calculated in the program it is very slow. I generally do not intend for this program to be used and upgraded past this point. Given the scalability issues it would make sense to integrate changes directly into the abcEconomics library. The code's availability is so others can use it if they want to dive deeper into the research presented in the paper.
